# Front End Design Elective

## Autumn 2022

### What is this?

In order to solve the exam assignment, you have to hook up to a server we've built.

You only need one server per group, so choose one to do it.

1. Go to <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku.com</a> and sign up for a free account.
2. Once signed up, click this link <br><a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/PandaPoob/foofest_data/tree/master"><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy"></a>
3. That will start the deployment of a new server.
4. Pick a unique name for it
5. and choose Europe as the location
6. Click "Deploy App"
7. Once it has finished, you should be able to click "Open app". That will open a rather boring page, try appending `/bands` to the URL to verify it's working
